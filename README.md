<h1>Habit Tracker App</h1>


The Habit Tracker app is a simple web application that allows users to track their habits and monitor their progress. It provides a calendar view to visualize habit completion for each day and displays habit details in individual habit cards. Users can add new habits, update existing ones, and delete habits they no longer wish to track.

Features
Calendar View: The app includes a calendar component that displays the days of the week and the dates for the current month. Each date cell is styled based on whether it belongs to the current month, today, or the current week.

Habit Cards: The app uses habit cards to display habit details, such as the title, description, and habit status. Habit cards also include a progress bar that dynamically updates based on the number of "done" days, providing users with a visual representation of their habit completion.

Add New Habits: Users can add new habits to the app using the "Add Habit" feature. The app provides a form where users can enter the habit title and description. Upon submission, the new habit is added to the habit list.

Delete Habits: Users can remove habits from the app by clicking the trash icon on each habit card. This feature allows users to declutter their habit list and focus on the habits they want to track.

Technologies Used
React: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Redux: Redux is used for state management, allowing efficient handling of habit data and status.

Tailwind CSS: The app utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

dayjs: The app uses the dayjs library to handle date calculations and formatting in the calendar component.
